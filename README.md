**Project Structure**

The application has two parts: web-page with input field and submit button for creating an order and telegram-bot. Bot publishes these orders to telegram channel, and sends information about order to user, who is ready to fulfill it.     
The *manage.py* file is the main file, where flask app is run, and bot initializes. Also, botâ€™s behavior is described here.   
The concept of blueprint is used in application. The blueprint is created in constructor of *app/main* package and is registered in *app* package constructor. Also, there are the date base configuration settings in *app* package constructor.   
The *model.py* file is used to create the models and work with database.   
The *views.py* file contains logic of application. There is a method for getting information about the order from web-site and sending it to bot.  
The *ajax.js* file is used for validating input field for phone number and sending requests to backend and changing *base.html* without reloading page.  
There is *template* folder for html files, and *static* folder for css and js files.
